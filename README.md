## OBJECTIVE
The objective of this project is to predict user churn for Sparkify, a digital music service. Churn prediction is critical to reducing customer attrition, enabling Sparkify to take targeted actions to retain at-risk users. Using a smaller subset of the data in this workspace and Spark for processing, this project will build a model to predict churn by analyzing user activity patterns.
