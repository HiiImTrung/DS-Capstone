## OBJECTIVE
The objective of this project is to predict user churn for Sparkify, a digital music service. Churn prediction is critical to reducing customer attrition, enabling Sparkify to take targeted actions to retain at-risk users. Using a smaller subset of the data in this workspace and Spark for processing, this project will build a model to predict churn by analyzing user activity patterns.

- Getting Started: To get started with this project, follow these steps:

- Load and Clean Dataset: Start by loading the dataset (mini_sparkify_event_data.json) and perform basic data cleaning operations to handle missing or invalid data.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct exploratory data analysis to understand user behavior, session activity, and other relevant patterns in the data.

- Define Churn: Define churn based on specific events, such as "Cancellation Confirmation," to create a label for our predictive model.

- Explore Data: Explore the data further to observe differences in behavior between users who churned and those who stayed.

- Feature Engineering: Extract relevant features from the dataset to train our predictive model. Ensure scalability and adherence to best practices in feature engineering.

- Modeling: Split the dataset into train, test, and validation sets. Test various machine learning methods, evaluate model performance, and optimize based on metrics such as F1 score.
